end
        Output: **Which developers was the task delegated to:** Back End Tech Lead

**Feedback received, which relevant guidelines were followed or not:** The Back End Tech Lead provided feedback suggesting avoiding adding columns to large tables to prevent long migration times and potential performance issues. They also recommended considering a join table or another method to manage `selected_course_id`. Additionally, they suggested adding an index on `selected_course_id` to improve query performance.

**Code diff:**
```ruby
class AddSelectedCourseIdToTournaments2 < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    # Adding columns to large tables
    # Fields added on big tables should be avoided due to long migration times and performance issues.
    # Consider if the selected_course_id can be managed through a join table or another method.

    # Adding selected_course_id to tournaments2_specs and tournaments2_events tables
    # Ensure selected_course_id follows ID type rules: numeric decimal 22, precision 0
    add_column :tournaments2_specs, :selected_course_id, :decimal, precision: 22, scale: 0
    add_column :tournaments2_events, :selected_course_id, :decimal, precision: 22, scale: 0

    # Index warning: Add an index on selected_course_id as it is not a text column
    add_index :tournaments2_specs, :selected_course_id, name: 'index_tournaments2_specs_on_selected_course_id'
    add_index :tournaments2_events, :selected_course_id, name: 'index_tournaments2_events_on_selected_course_id'
  end
end
```

**Conclusion:**
1. The code correctly follows the rule for ID type fields by setting `selected_course_id` as a `decimal` with precision 22 and scale 0.
2. Adding columns to large tables like `tournaments2_specs` and `tournaments2_events` should be avoided to prevent long migration times and performance issues. A join table or another method is recommended for managing `selected_course_id`.
3. An index on `selected_course_id` fields was added to improve query performance, making the migration more efficient and maintainable.

        Task: Take a look at this code diff:  # Generic WHS
  courses.generic_whs_initialize_select = (level) ->

      courses.generic_whs_on_select(level)
        Output: **Which developers was the task delegated to:** Front End Tech Lead, Summary Specialist

**Feedback received, which relevant guidelines were followed or not:** 
The Front End Tech Lead suggested the following improvements: 
1. Cache jQuery selectors to improve performance.
2. Ensure proper indentation and formatting for readability.
3. Use consistent syntax for method calls and arrow functions.

**Code diff:**
```javascript
# Generic WHS
courses.generic_whs_initialize_select = (level) ->
  level_data = window.generic_whs_targets[level]
  $selectElement = $(level_data["id"])
  $selectElement.select2({
    language: {
      noResults: () ->
        I18n.t('assets.javascripts.application.courses.select2.no_results')
    },
    placeholder: I18n.t("assets.javascripts.application.courses.select_a_#{level}"),
    width: "100%",
    dropdownParent: $(".fancybox-inner .import_generic_whs_popup").closest(".fancybox-wrap")
  })
  window.glg.new_design_shared.computeAndApplyBorder()
  $(document).off("select2:select", level_data["id"])
  $(document).on("select2:select", level_data["id"], () ->
    courses.generic_whs_on_select(level)
  )
```

**Conclusion:**
The provided JavaScript code was reviewed by the Front End Tech Lead, who suggested caching the jQuery selector, ensuring proper indentation, and using consistent syntax for method calls and arrow functions. These improvements enhance the code's performance, readability, and maintainability. The updated code reflects these changes and adheres to best practices.

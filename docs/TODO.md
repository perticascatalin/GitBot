# GitBot V1

## A. Agents

### 1. Code Summary

&#x2610; Summary for code differences telling what they are about. Can maybe go to summary_specialist. Eg. when there is no specific rule applicable, at least it can deduct what the code does.

### 2. Crew Dynamic

&#x2610; Improve the crew dynamic by:

    - Establishing clearer roles
    - Adding structure to messages sent within the group 
    - Defining rules for collaboration and delegation

### 3. Define more agents

&#x2610; Example: python vs ruby specialist

## B. Service

### 1. API

&#x2610; How do you expose the API correctly to potential clients. Idea: use multiple ports for ngrok.

&#x2610; Defining the API, what data it receives and what data it sends back

## C. User Interface

### 1. Git Hunks

&#x2610; User will see git hub commits commented per hunk. Right now comment placed at beginning of hunk. If hunk is very large, you will see a large message (because of code diff large), then the actual code changes. This needs to be improved.
